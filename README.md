- used Copilot for simple code generation like filters or endpoint calls and for CSS
- created api folder with different files for different types of endpoints ( point could be made that badges and leagues are of the same entity, but I wanted to show how we can split them)
- created new Leagues component ( I could also work on creating a bigger component to include filters and table and then add that to App but I used App as a place to define filters; not necessarily correct in bigger applications)
- used a table to show league details, could have also added pagination or infinite scrolling for longer lists and paginated endpoints
- could have added a toggle for badge
